# Introduction
- This Game is a Computer Architure Lab Assignment
- By doing this Assignment, we will cover these topics in MIPS: Arithmetic and Data Transfer Instructions, Conditional Branch, Unconditional Jump Instructions, and the Design of Procedures.

# Game Rules:
*You can see the more specific rules in Submission_Report.pdf file*

## Setting Stage:
- Players can input whatever ship of the size 2, 3 or 4 as they want, except that they can only put that ship onto their board if it is available.
- Errors will be displayed as player input the wrong coordinates for their ship, wrong size, out of bounds, no ship available, ...

## Hitting Stage:
- Player takes the turn to perform a hit on other player's board (the hit will be saved on player's view board)
- The Game will announce if it is a valid Hit: if invalid, the game will ask the player to input the hit again; otherwise, it will tell if it is a Hit or a Miss.
- A player will be announced as a Winner whenever he/she hits all ships of other player.

# How to run This Game:
- This game is coded using MIPS, a RISC Assembly Language. So if you want to run the code, you need to install Mars45.jar, which is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS Assembly Language (*You can check this link: https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/*)
- When open the code file (.asm) in Mars45.jar, just only click Run then you can interact with the game via the Terminal.
